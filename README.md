# Modules
## [Particle Image Velocimetry](PIV)
Flow visualization of a jet exiting a pump: preparation of flow tracers, image acquisition and data processing.

## [Particle Tracking Velocimetry](PTV)
Automated tracking of air bubbles rising in a water column: image acquisition, particle detection and linking, trajectory reconstruction.

## [Fast Imaging](Fast)
Acquiring high speed phenomena: the bursting of a balloon filled with water.

## [Pendant Drop](Drop)
Pattern recognition and feature extraction from an image: surface tension measurement by the method of the pendant drop.

# Installations & Downloads
The 4 modules rely strongly on the following free and open source softwares:
- [ImageJ](https://fiji.sc/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/), from [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/)
- Python packages: [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/), [trackpy](http://soft-matter.github.io/trackpy/)

The processing for PTV, Drop and Fast will be made on the lab computers, you will run the PIV processing from your personal laptop.
See details in the different modules, and we can help for the installation.

# High Speed Imaging
High Speed Imaging is a technique to take [pictures](https://edgerton.mit.edu/high-speed-imaging/high-speed-images) of very fast phenomena.

Unlike still-motion photography, it requires a very high frame-rate which can pose challenges for a researcher.
1) The camera must have the sensor, hardware, and software capable of operating at high frame rate. (High Cost)
2) Even the best cameras cannot make use of their full sensor at their highest frame rates; the resolution of the images must be reduced. (Limited Resolution)
3) The high frame rate bounds the possible exposure time which decreases the amount of light the sensor can receive. (Low Light)
4) The lack of light typically means that other features (aperature, etc) must be used to compensate for this. (Reduced Depth of Field, etc)

Sometimes even the best cameras available are still not able to capture the desired phenomena (or if we look to history they hadn't yet been invented).
The common approach in this case is to only turn on the light source (typically an arc flash or high speed strobe) for a small portion of the sensor's exposure time.
It wasn't too many years ago that all high-speed motion was produced in this fasion.

While this technique can easily produce an image, the challenge becomes a matter of timing the flash relative to the event.
If the time between the event happening and the flash can be made consistent, then a sequential series of pictures can be compiled.
Common means of triggering the cameras employ sound, pressure switches, lasers, etc.
A beautiful [example](https://gfm.aps.org/meetings/dfd-2014/5408ec6e69702d07711b0200) of this behavior was used to visualize spray and breakup. The camera's frame rate was a mere 20,000 fps but they were able to achieve an effective 10 Million fps.

For our class, we will not need to sample faster than the available frame-rate of the camera.
But we will need to use bright lights to provide enough information for the sensor, and a lens must be used which can capture the desired field of view on the reduced sensor size.
